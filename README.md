Arduino Hydroponic Controller Build - Alpha

I am new to Arduino as for coding, it takes me 3 hours what a normal programmer does in 1.  I have managed many programming projects and hope people will be interested in being a part of designing a state of the art hydroponic grow controller and web interface.

Co2 Monitor and Release System

Lighting Monitor (On/Off), PAR, Energy Used Etc.

Humidity Monitor and Controller for associated systems

Water Level Sensor and Temperature for Resevoir Systems and individual DWC buckets.

Touch Screen Monitor to display any data collected by components and can be completely customized or use our templates.

Smart Power Strip with backup (APC API preferred)

I have some of this code already but am new to Github.  I apoligize in advance and hopefully will pick this up fairly quickly.

ANYONE IS WELCOME TO HELP 

I am a cancer survivor, veteran, and volunteer in many orgranizations that help our country and others.  
This is an area that I feel needs somethings inexpensive to replace the $1000-5000 units they sell today.

This is another way to give back........pay it foorward.  (25 years hydroponics experience - coding well a long time but very few lines :-)
